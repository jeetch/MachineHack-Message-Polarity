# Message Polarity Prediction : Weekend Hackathon #3



All of us receive a ton of messages and emails on a daily basis. Collectively, that is a lot of data which can provide useful insights about the messages that each of us gets. What if you could know whether a certain message has brought you good news or bad news before opening the actual message. In this challenge, we will use Machine Learning to achieve this.

Given are 53 distinguishing factors that can help in understanding the polarity(Good or Bad) of a message,  your objective as a data scientist is to build a Machine Learning model that can predict whether a text message has brought you good news or bad news.
